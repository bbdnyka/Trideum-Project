# Trideum-Project
Project Overview:
The primary objective of this project is to build a web application that uses MIL-STD-2525b or MIL-STD-2525d map symbols and displays them on a map to create a digital military sand table. A military sand table is used by the military to plan and visualize missions. Soldiers use mini-models and markers on the sand to represent different elements like troops, buildings, and terrain. It helps commanders make tactical decisions and is often used in training and planning sessions.

Components and Technology:

Front-end Framework: User-Interface: ReactJS, Mapping Library: CesiumJS 

Back-end System / API: Django, Symbol Generation: Existing MIL-STD-2525 symbol API

Database Integration: Mongo. Store MIL-STD-2525 symbol data and user inputs for efficient retrieval and management.
